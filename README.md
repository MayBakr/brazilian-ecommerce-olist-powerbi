# Brazilian E-Commerce Olist Insights (Power BI Project)

***Project Overview***  
This project analyzes the **Brazilian E-Commerce Olist dataset (2016–2018)** to uncover sales, customer, seller, and operational insights. Using **Power BI**, I developed interactive dashboards and visuals to explore key business questions, highlight performance trends, and provide actionable insights.

## Objectives

- Evaluate seller and product performance.  
- Analyze customer demographics and purchasing behavior.  
- Assess operational and shipping efficiency.  

## Business Questions Addressed
1. What is the total revenue trend over time?  
2. How do payment methods influence revenue?  
3. Which product categories generate the most revenue?  
4. How does seller distribution affect sales and efficiency?  
5. What are the highest revenue-generating customer regions?  
6. What percentage of orders are on-time vs. delayed?  
7. How do average delivery and processing times vary across categories?
